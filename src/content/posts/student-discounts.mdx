## Who is this article for?

In this article, I will list some of the best deals you can get as a student. While there are different types of discounts for students, I will write about the ones that are useful for developer students.
  

### #0 Apple Mac and iPad. 
Developers start from index 0 so let's keep it that way ðŸ˜Ž.

Before we start coding, we need a decent computer. If you are planning to buy an Apple device, you can get a roughly 10% discount on Mac computers or around 5% on iPads 

To get the Apple student discount, you need to bring your Student ID to the Apple Store.
You can also verify your eligibility online with [UNiDAYS](https://www.myunidays.com/IN/en-IN/partners/appleeducationstore/spotlight/online) or through an [Apple Specialist](https://www.apple.com/in/shop/education-pricing).
Online verification may not be that straightforward, depending on your location and University.

You can view all products with student discounts [here](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop)

If you are in South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· like me, visit [this link](https://www.apple.com/kr-k12/shop)

### #1 GitHub Student Developer Pack

GitHub Student Developer Pack is one of the best discounts for developer students. Using this pack, you will get access to Github's pro features, such as private repository. But most importantly, this pack will give students free access to more than 100 tools or services provided by Github partners. I will talk about some of them in this article, but you can view all offers <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">here</a> 


To get GitHub Student Developer Pack, you would need a school-issued email or student ID. But you can still apply for this pack without a school-issued email or ID by providing necessary documents that prove that you are a student. Learn more about it in <a href="https://github.blog/2019-07-30-how-to-get-the-github-student-developer-pack-without-a-student-id/#:~:text=If%20you%20don't%20have,verify%20your%20current%20student%20status." target="_blank">Github's official guideline</a>

### #2 Frontend Masters Courses

<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/" target="_blank">Frontend Masters</a> is a subscription-based online learning platform, and all courses are taught by industry-leading experts. The Courses are targetted at frontend developers, although there are some courses on backend languages and DevOps.
Unlike Udemy, most courses cover intermediate and advanced topics.

You can get free 6-months access to all Courses in Frontend Masters by using GitHub Student Developer Pack.
You need to connect your GitHub account to Frontend Masters after signing up. [Learn more here](https://frontendmasters.com/welcome/github-student-developers/)

If you need a step-by-step guideline, you can follow [this random guy](https://youtu.be/bdCxY3n2yYk).

I usually prefer official documentations and tutorials when I want to learn something. But Frontend Masters is one of my favorite learning platforms when it comes to video-based courses. It is my Netflix when I get lazy or tired but still wants to learn something ðŸ˜ƒ.

I'd highly recommend [JavaScript: The Hard Parts V2
](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/), even if you already know most of these topics.

If you want to level up your command-line skills and intimidate non-devs ðŸ˜…, [Complete Intro to Linux and the Command-Line](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/linux-command-line/) is an excellent course.

### #3 Educative Courses
While video courses are great for understanding complex concepts, text-based tutorials are usually less time-consuming. If you prefer learning by reading, [Educative](https://www.educative.io/) is a great learning platform. All courses in Educative are text-based, and they have a wide range of courses. You can explore [all courses here](https://www.educative.io/explore).

You can get free 6-months access to [60+ courses](https://www.educative.io/m/github-student-course-list) on Educative using GitHub Student Developer Pack. Visit [this link](https://www.educative.io/github-students) to claim the offer.

I took some courses on Educative using my GitHub Pack and highly enjoyed them. But some courses might be a little lacking, depending on the author. In such cases, I prefer official documentations.

### #4 JetBrains Developer Tools

JetBrains is well known for its [cutting-edge IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide) such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc. While these IDEs have community editions for free, commercial editions give you additional features that you don't get in free versions.

As a student, you get a free subscription which you have to renew annually. So all JetBrains developer tools are free as long as you are a student.

You can apply for JetBrains student subscription in different methods such as using the university email address or Github Student Developer Pack or official document. [Learn more](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students).

### #5 Credits for cloud services.

With your GitHub Student Developer Pack, you can get various cloud services such as Cloud Virtual Machines, Serverless functions, App Services for building and deploying your web apps, etc.

1. For example, DigitalOcean gives [100$ credit for students](https://www.digitalocean.com/github-students/) to be used in one year.
2. You can get [100$ credit for Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) as well, which is also valid for one year. 
3. You can get $200 credit in MongoDB Atlas and free access to MongoDB Compass and MongoDB University training courses. [Learn more here](https://www.mongodb.com/students)

4. If you need a cloud server to deploy and manage your apps, Heroku offers students [one free Hobby Dyno](https://www.heroku.com/github-students) for up to 2 years. [Visit this link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-types) to understand how Heroku Dynos work.

### #6 Microsoft Office 365 
Office apps are not related to programming, but you might need them in some University classes.
[Office365 education subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office) includes several office apps such as PowerPoint, Word, Outlook, and whatnots.

As far as I know, you need a school-issued email to be eligible for this subscription. You can visit [Office 365 Education homepage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/office) for further information.

If you are a student at Sejong University (the same university I graduated from), you can apply for an office 365 account at [this link](https://o365.sejong.ac.kr/mysql/User/login.jsp?failMsg=failed&mLng=eng).
