Integrated the "Ethos everywhere" Chrome extension to several products, such as Twitter, Kaito, and OpenSea. It shows ethos credibility scores in these platforms so that users can avoid low-credibility profiles and scams. I've added extended features to X (formerly Twitter) such as displaying reputation markets, hiding posts from low-credibility profiles, and showing ethos stats in profile pages. Preferred platforms and features can be customized easily from the pop-up UI.

## Key Features

- Credibility scores display on multiple platforms
- Integration with Twitter/X, Kaito, and OpenSea
