GoL2 is an innovative gaming project built on StarkNet, a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. This project reimagines the classic "Game of Life" by John Conway, integrating it with blockchain technology to create a unique, interactive experience. In this project, I worked extensively with Web3 technologies, such as migrating the game to a new contract and adding NFT minting. I also optimized the web game by adding infinite queries instead of loading thousands of games at once.

## Key Features

- Classic Conway's Game of Life reimagined for Web3
- Built on StarkNet Layer 2 for Ethereum
- NFT minting capabilities for game snapshots
- Infinite scrolling and pagination for performance
- Smart contract integration for game logic

## Key Contributions

- Migrated the game to new smart contracts
- Implemented NFT minting functionality for game snapshots
- Optimized performance with infinite queries and pagination
- Enhanced user experience with improved loading
- Integrated Web3 wallet connectivity

## Technologies Used

- StarkNet.js
- Web3 technologies
- Smart contract integration
- React for frontend
- Infinite query optimization
- NFT minting protocols
